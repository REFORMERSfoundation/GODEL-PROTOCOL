THE GÖDEL PROTOCOL
Incompleteness theorems are the only truly secure cryptographic protocols in the entire embodiment
of mathematics.


i = Interlocking all hyperblocks by a45transformation.
(𝛼) = Transfers number notation into ordinal numbers.
{(𝚽)} = First vault, attackers encounter first incompleteness theorem.
[{(𝚽)}] = Second vault, attackers encounter second incompleteness theorem.
⟦[{(𝚽)}]⟧ = Internal security protocol prohibiting AGI-ASI mounted attack. 
⟦[{(𝚮𝚲)}]⟧ = Gӧdel operators lenticular brackets omit everything inside them.


The first genesis block of all current Blockchains lack validation and certification of its existence, 
more importantly, besides the hash function no security system has been established at specific points 
of the Blockchain development.

To establish coordinated checkpoints througout both, master chain and supply chains must be paramount.

We establish the agreement of at least three independent human agents for the legitimacy 
of the first genesis block, and strategic security checkpoints throughout the eight master chains, 
of our four dimensional LÖCKLEDGER and must be established such that:

𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ+0𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ-0𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲* ⟦[{(𝚽έ0pwq*)}]⟧ = 000
𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ+1𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ-1𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲* ⟦[{(𝚽έ0pwq*)}]⟧ = 000
𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ-2𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{( 𝚮𝚲i𝚺 έ+2𝚷 pwq*)}]⟧ + 𝚮𝚲* ⟦[{(𝚽έ0pwq*)}]⟧ = 000

The positive independent human-agent supervisor 𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{(𝚮𝚲έ+0pwq*)}]⟧ compares non-contaminated result 
𝚮𝚲 ⟦[{(𝚮𝚲έ-0pwq*)}]⟧ against the negative independent human agent supervisor non-contaminated result.

If no two human agents result is different than zero (0) for the creation, validation and certification 
of the first genesis block of the hypercube, then the hypercube comes into existence, thus promoting 
LÖCKLEDGER into existence.
